<ol>
  <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Tracking and managing changes to code.</li>
  <li>Title. Example at the top.</li>
  <li>p</li>
  <li>a is the odd one out because it inserts hyperlinks into code, whereas the others concern text.
  <li> nav and href.</li>
  <li> img. attributes: src, alt.</li>
  <li>b is the odd one out because this bolds text. The others pertain to table design.</li>
  <li>#66ff99</li>
  <li>The name attribute specifies something in the HTML code. The value attribute specifies something in an input element.</li>
  <li><p style="color:green;">green paragraph.</p></li>
  <li>You link an external style sheet by opening a new folder inside of the project folder, then by linking a CSS to your main .html index.</li>.
  <li>
  .center {
  position:absolute
  width:200px
  height:200px</li>  
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>alert("I love JavaScript");</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Jquery: class="myClass" JavaScript:var messages = document.querySelectorAll(".my-class");</li>
  <li>Inputtype="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}">
  <li>This will seem like a bad answer, but I preferred working with HTML because it was the one that I understood the most (not that I understood it very well, mind you). The others, I feel, need a course of their own for me to truly get a grasp of how to use them. Even HTML should have a course of its own because I definitely do not have a solid understanding of how to use it effectively. Computer coding is way over my head and way outside of my wheelhouse in terms of knowledge or understanding. There is a very steep learning curve when it comes to stuff like this.</li>
